I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at the [Department of
Mathematics](https://www.math.uci.edu/) at [University
of California, Irvine](https://www.math.uci.edu/). During Sep. 2021 to June
2024, I was a Postdoc at the [Department of Mathematics](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), under the mentorship of Dr. [Gieri Simonett](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/simoneg/). My Ph.D. journey took place at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), under the guidance of Dr. [Changyou Wang](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~wang2482/).

My research interests include the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), hydrodynamics of complex fluids, calculus of variations, geometric flows, stochastic analysis, and the interplay between PDEs and machine learning.
