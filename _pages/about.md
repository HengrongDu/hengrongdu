I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Mathematics](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/), [Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/), where I collaborate closely with Dr. [Gieri Simonett](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/simoneg/). I earned my Ph.D. from the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), under the guidance of Dr. [Changyou Wang](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~wang2482/). My research delves into the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, I explore areas like the hydrodynamics of complex fluids, the calculus of variations, geometric flows, stochastic analysis, and the interplay between PDEs and machine learning.
