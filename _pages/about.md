I am currently a postdoc researcher at [Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Gieri Simonett](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/simoneg/). I obtained my Ph. D. degree at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. [Changyou Wang](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~wang2482/). My current research primarily concerns questions related to the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), with an emphasis on the hydrodynamics of complex fluids, the calculus of variations, geometric flows, stochastic analysis, and machine learning.
